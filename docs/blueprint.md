- Accent color: Dusty lavender (#9FA8DA), an analogous color with less brightness than the primary color.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headings and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent data entities and actions.
- Use a clean, modern layout with plenty of white space to ensure readability and focus.
- Use subtle animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) for data updates and transitions.
